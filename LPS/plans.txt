======== Urgent List ========

correctly calculate the time taken to start and complete a request
Provide Statistics
use fluent validation for the domain

add header validation to http 2 requests and possibly refactor the http client service
Put all test plans in one folder
use prompt plus

create, update, delete commands
Json Repository
move the infra logic to infra logic
Integrated Metric pipeline
When creating a repository, create IEntityPolicy so the repository applies then before an entity is saved or updated => for example, immutable field like an Id
document how to use dot net trace

======== To Do List ========
//ToDo: Implement CleanUp Cookies
Gather the logs of each request and its associated response in one log file // this requires a logger manager to create a logger each time a case is executed

Review the desgin relationships
Cookie manager to support custom cookies and support enabling disabling cookies per domain. For now cookies are enabled by defaults for all clients and all domains
redirects - Http Redirections for now is enabled for all domains and all clients

cache manager
shared settings across all requests 
Remove Completed Tasks

command to run multiple plans??


private async Task RemoveCompletedTasks(List<Task> tasks, CancellationToken token)
{
    int sizeInBytes = int.MaxValue;
    while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        if (sizeInBytes > 10485760)
        {
            await _logger.LogAsync("1111111111", "Removing completed tasks, list is greater than 10 MB", LoggingLevel.WRN);

            sizeInBytes = tasks.Count * Marshal.SizeOf(typeof(Task));
            var completedTasks = tasks.Where(t => t.IsCompleted || t.IsCanceled || t.IsFaulted).ToList();
            foreach (var task in completedTasks)
            {
                tasks.Remove(task);
            }
        }
        await Task.Delay(20000);
    }
}
