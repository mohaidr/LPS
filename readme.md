# LPS Command-Line Tool Documentation

### Overview
The LPS tool is designed for Load, Performance, and Stress testing of web applications. It allows users to design, manage, and execute a variety of HTTP-based tests to assess application performance under simulated load conditions.

The LPS tool is distinctively built around the concept of iteration modes, setting it apart from other testing tools. This design choice emphasizes flexibility and ease of use, allowing users to run diverse testing scenarios by simply specifying a few key parameters. The iteration modes are central to the tool's functionality, offering a robust way to customize how HTTP requests are issued during tests.

### What is an Iteration Mode?
Iteration Mode is a fundamental feature of the LPS tool that dictates the pattern and timing of HTTP requests during a test. This mode allows users to precisely model different user interactions and system loads by managing the sequence and behavior of requests. The Iteration Mode specifies how HTTP requests are structured and executed during a test run, allowing you to mimic different user interaction patterns and system loads, it adjusts the sequencing and timing of requests based on predefined behaviors. 

Here's a clear description of each available mode and what they entail:

#### CB (Cooldown-Batchsize)CB (Cooldown-Batchsize)
   **Description**: In this mode, HTTP requests are issued in batches specified by the --batchsize option. After each batch is sent, the test pauses for a period defined by the --coolDownTime. This mode is useful for testing how well the application handles bursts of traffic followed by periods of inactivity.

**Use Case:** Ideal for scenarios where you want to simulate users coming in waves, such as during a flash sale or a timed quiz on an educational website.

#### CRB (Cooldown-Request-Batchsize)CRB (Cooldown-Request-Batchsize)
**Description**: This mode extends the CB mode by allowing control over the total number of requests (--requestCount) in addition to batch size and cooldown periods. It ensures that the entire test run sends a precise number of requests, distributed across several batches with rest periods in between.

**Use Case**: Suitable for more detailed stress testing where the total load and its distribution over time are critical, such as testing e-commerce sites on Black Friday sales.

#### D (Duration)
**Description**: In the Duration mode, requests are continuously sent for the specified time period (--duration). Similar to the Request Count mode, each request in this mode is issued sequentially; a new request is sent only after the previous one completes. This mode evaluates the endurance of the application by maintaining a consistent load over an extended period.

**Use Case**: This mode is ideal for scenarios where the performance stability of an application over time is critical. Itâ€™s especially relevant for services that expect consistent usage, such as continuous data entry systems or online examination platforms where users might be interacting with the system steadily over lengthy sessions.

#### DCB (Duration-Cooldown-Batchsize)DCB (Duration-Cooldown-Batchsize)
**Description**: Combines the elements of duration and CB mode. Requests are sent in batches for the total duration of the test, with cooldown periods between each batch. This hybrid approach provides a comprehensive stress test scenario.

**Use Case**: Perfect for applications requiring reliability under periodic spikes in user activity, such as online ticketing services during event launches.

#### R (Request Count)
**Description**: In the Request Count mode, the tool is set to send a predetermined total number of requests (--requestCount). Each request is sent individually, one after another, with the next request only being dispatched after the previous one has completed. This mode is designed to assess how the application handles a steady stream of incoming requests, one at a time.

**Use Case**: This is particularly useful for testing the application's capacity to process consecutive requests efficiently. It simulates a scenario where users perform actions one after another, such as submitting forms or completing sequential tasks on a workflow application. It's an excellent way to measure how well the server recovers and readies itself for the next request under a controlled load.

### Flexibility and Testing Capabilities:Flexibility and Testing Capabilities:
The iteration modes provide significant flexibility in how tests are structured, allowing testers to closely mimic a variety of real-world scenarios. By varying the sequence and intensity of load conditions, these modes help identify potential performance bottlenecks and ensure that the application is robust enough to handle different types of user interactions and traffic patterns. This tailored approach is crucial for developing highly reliable and scalable web applications.
